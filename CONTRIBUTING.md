#How to contribute?

I'll be writing an extensive contributor's guide but for now - 

If anyone is having hard time with code coverage or failing tests, you could bypass the githooks by adding a simple flag `--no-verify`. 

Example - 
`git commit --no-verify` 

Though first you may want to file an issue so that we could solve the problem then and there. All the best!
